## Features: 
- Main Page: The main page of the website provides an option to view the picture of the day or to search your own date. 
- Image Viewing Page: This page allows users to view the Astronomy Picture of the Day in more detail. Users have two options to select an image:
-  Today's Image: By default, the page displays the image of the current day. Users can get additional information about the image, such as its title, date, and a detailed description.
- Search by Date: Users can input a specific date to view the Astronomy Picture of the Day from that date. If an image is available for the selected date, it will be displayed along with its details.

# Learning Outcome
During the development of this project, I had the opportunity to learn and achieve the following:

## Deployment and Backend Implementation
- Successfully deployed the website live.
- Gained hands-on experience in implementing backend code.
- Received valuable guidance and support from my mentor, Byron, and my friend, Noel.
## Securing API Key
- Learned how to protect sensitive information, such as API keys, by using an environment file (.env).
- Utilized the .gitignore file to ensure the API key remains hidden and not exposed in version control.
## HTTP Requests and Routing
- Acquired knowledge on using HTTP requests such as GET and POST.
- Implemented routes for different functionalities within the project.
- Gained a basic understanding of Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime environment.
By undertaking this project and collaborating with my mentor and friend, I enhanced my understanding of backend development and acquired practical skills in deploying websites, securing sensitive information, and working with HTTP requests. These newfound skills and experiences will undoubtedly serve as a solid foundation for my future projects and professional growth.
